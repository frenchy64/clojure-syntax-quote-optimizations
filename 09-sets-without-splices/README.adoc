= Sets Without Splices Optimization for Syntax-Quote
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Overview

This subproject contains the analysis and verification of optimizing syntax-quoted sets that don't have top-level splices (`~@`). Instead of using the verbose `(apply hash-set (seq (concat ...)))` construction, we use more direct forms:
- Empty sets: `#{}`
- Singleton sets: `#{:a}`  
- Multi-element sets: `(hash-set :a :b ...)`

This optimization is part of https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2908[CLJ-2908: Optimize syntax-quote] and follows the same pattern as the maps without splices optimization.

== The Optimization

For sets without top-level splices, we can avoid the overhead of `concat`, `seq`, and `apply`:

**Before:**
- `` `#{:a :b :c} `` => `(apply hash-set (seq (concat (list :a) (list :b) (list :c))))`

**After:**
- `` `#{} `` => `#{}`
- `` `#{:a} `` => `#{:a}`
- `` `#{:a :b :c} `` => `(hash-set :a :b :c)`

**Why this is safe:** When there are no splices, we know exactly what elements will be in the set at compile time. We can therefore use simpler construction methods that avoid runtime sequence operations.

**Constraint:** This optimization only applies when there are no top-level splices (`~@`) in the set.

**Patch file:** `sets-without-splices.patch`

**Target commit:** See `CLOJURE_VERSION` file in repository root (Clojure 1.12.3 release)

**Reference:** This optimization is extracted from the comprehensive work in https://github.com/frenchy64/clojure/pull/41[PR #41]. See `optimize-syntax-quote-full.patch` at the repository root for the complete patch.

== Code Changes

The patch modifies the `IPersistentSet` case in `syntaxQuote()` method of `LispReader.java`:

```java
ISeq seq = ((IPersistentSet) form).seq();
// `#{~@a b ~@c} => (apply hash-set (concat a [b] c))
if(hasSplice(seq))
    ret = RT.list(APPLY, HASHSET, RT.cons(CONCAT, sqExpandList(seq)));
// `#{} => #{}
else if(seq == null)
    ret = PersistentHashSet.EMPTY;
// `#{a} => #{`a}
else if(seq.count() == 1)
    ret = PersistentHashSet.create(RT.toArray(sqExpandFlat(seq)));
// `#{a ~b c} => (hash-set `a b `c)
else
    ret = RT.cons(HASHSET, sqExpandFlat(seq));
```

Helper functions added:
- `hasSplice(ISeq seq)` - Returns true if seq contains `~@`
- `sqExpandFlat(ISeq seq)` - Flattens seq treating `~@` as `~` for direct calls

== Building the Optimized Uberjar

Use the shared build script:

```bash
./build-optimized-uberjar.sh [output_dir]
```

This script:
1. Clones the official Clojure repository at the target commit
2. Applies the sets-without-splices.patch
3. Builds the uberjar with Maven
4. Strips nondeterministic data and computes SHA256
5. Saves the result to the output directory

== Experiments

=== 1. Uberjar Comparison

**Directory:** `experiments/uberjar-comparison/`

Measures the overall impact of the sets without splices optimization on the complete Clojure uberjar:
- Total size reduction
- Number of affected class files
- Bytecode instruction differences

**Run:**
```bash
cd experiments/uberjar-comparison/
./01-sets-without-splices.sh
```

== Hypothesis

Sets without splices appear in Clojure code:
- Most syntax-quoted sets don't use splices
- Multi-element sets like `` `#{:a :b :c} `` appear in various contexts
- Protocol sets, interface sets, and tag sets

We hypothesize that:
1. Avoiding `concat`/`seq`/`apply` significantly reduces bytecode size
2. Using `(hash-set e ...)` is more direct and efficient
3. The optimization will show measurable improvements across the Clojure codebase

== Results Summary

Results will be documented after running the experiment.

== Comparison with Previous Optimizations

| Aspect | Empty Collections | Singleton Sets | Sets Without Splices |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Frequency | High | Low-Moderate | Moderate |
| Bytecode savings | ~50-150 bytes | ~50-100 bytes | ~40-80 bytes per set |
| Scope | Empty sets | 1-element sets | All non-splice sets |
