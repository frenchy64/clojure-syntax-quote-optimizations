= Singleton Sets Optimization for Syntax-Quote
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Overview

This subproject contains the analysis and verification of optimizing syntax-quoted singleton sets (sets with exactly one element) to use set literals instead of verbose construction code.

This optimization is part of https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2908[CLJ-2908: Optimize syntax-quote] and follows the same pattern as the singleton maps optimization.

== The Optimization

Instead of expanding `` `#{:a} `` to `(apply hash-set (seq (concat (list :a))))`, the optimized reader expands it to `#{:a}`.

**Why this is safe:** Singleton sets trivially satisfy the distinct-elements requirement. Set literals must have distinct elements, but with only one element, there's no possibility of collision.

**Constraint:** This optimization only applies when there are no top-level splices (`~@`) in the set.

**Patch file:** `singleton-sets.patch`

**Target commit:** See `CLOJURE_VERSION` file in repository root (Clojure 1.12.3 release)

**Reference:** This optimization is extracted from the comprehensive work in https://github.com/frenchy64/clojure/pull/41[PR #41]. See `optimize-syntax-quote-full.patch` at the repository root for the complete patch.

== Code Changes

The patch modifies the `IPersistentSet` case in `syntaxQuote()` method of `LispReader.java`:

```java
ISeq seq = ((IPersistentSet) form).seq();
// `#{a} => #{`a}
if(seq != null && seq.count() == 1)
    ret = PersistentHashSet.create(RT.toArray(syntaxQuote(seq.first())));
else
    ret = RT.list(APPLY, HASHSET, RT.list(SEQ, RT.cons(CONCAT, sqExpandList(seq))));
```

This is a minimal patch that only optimizes singleton sets. It uses the existing `syntaxQuote` and `sqExpandList` functions from the codebase, requiring no additional helper functions.
- `sqExpandFlat(ISeq seq)` - Flattens seq treating `~@` as `~`

== Building the Optimized Uberjar

Use the shared build script:

```bash
./build-optimized-uberjar.sh [output_dir]
```

This script:
1. Clones the official Clojure repository at the target commit
2. Applies the singleton-sets.patch
3. Builds the uberjar with Maven
4. Strips nondeterministic data and computes SHA256
5. Saves the result to the output directory

== Experiments

=== 1. Uberjar Comparison

**Directory:** `experiments/uberjar-comparison/`

Measures the overall impact of the singleton sets optimization on the complete Clojure uberjar:
- Total size reduction
- Number of affected class files
- Bytecode instruction differences

**Run:**
```bash
cd experiments/uberjar-comparison/
./01-singleton-sets.sh
```

== Hypothesis

Singleton sets appear in Clojure code, particularly in:
- **Set literals in macros**: `` `#{~x} ``
- **Protocol/interface names**: `` `#{~protocol-name} ``
- **Single tag sets**: `` `#{:tag} ``

We hypothesize that:
1. Singleton sets occur frequently enough to provide measurable size reduction
2. Using set literals instead of apply/concat reduces bytecode size by ~50-100 bytes per occurrence
3. Runtime performance improves due to fewer function calls

== Results Summary

Results will be documented after running the experiment.

| Frequency | High | Moderate-High | Low-Moderate |
| Bytecode savings | ~50-150 bytes | ~50-100 bytes | ~50-100 bytes |
| Scope | Empty collections | 1-entry maps | 1-element sets |
